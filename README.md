[Discord Chainmail](https://discord-chainmail.numselli.xyz) is a website meant to inform people about fake chainmail messages on the chat platform [Discord](https://discord.com/). This website was inspired by seeing one of these chain messages and being so frustrated that people still believe these messages. Instead of producing rushed, flawed, and untrue reasons why they are fake on the spot I decided to make this site as a simple response.
