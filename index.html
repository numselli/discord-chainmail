					<h4>Intro</h4>
					<hr>
				</div>
				<div>
					I saw a message circulating on <a href="https://discord.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Discord imagine a place">Discord</a> that warned users not to add a user as a friend or else you would be hacked by them.
					I knew this message was fake because I have spent a lot of time working with discords backend.
					but when I went to explain why it is fake i was not able to come up with a solid reason 
					so i made this site

					here is an example of one of these messages:
				</div>
				<div>
					<blockquote>Please read this carefully: A fair warning, Look out for a Discord user by the name of "nekoCat" with the tag #8386. He is going around sending friend requests to random Discord users, and those who accept his friend requests will have their accounts DDoSed and their groups exposed with the members inside it becoming a victim as well. Spread the word and send this to as many discord servers as you can. If you see this user, DO NOT accept his friend request and immediately block him. Discord is currently working on it. SEND THIS TO ALL THE SERVERS YOU ARE IN. This is IMPORTANT: Do not accept a friend request from nekoCat#8386. He is a hacker. Tell everyone on your friends list because if somebody on your list adds one of them, they'll be on your list too. They will figure out your personal computer's IP and address, so copy & paste this message where ever you can. He is going around sending friend requests to random discord users, and those who accept his requests will have their accounts and their IP Addresses revealed to him. Spread the word and send this to as many discord servers as you can. If you see this user, DO NOT accept his friend request and immediately block him. Sorry for the ping! Stay safe please @everyone</blockquote>
				</div>

				<!-- <div style="padding-top: 0.5em;">
					I'm just sick of seeing people reposting this sort of stuff

					The message claims
					look out for a user 
					they are sending friend requests 


					by accespting one their friend request
					your account will be hacked
					the user will use you account to hack your friends

					the user will get your personal details 

					send this message to everywhere you can

			<!-- ip leakeds -->
			<div id="ipLeaks">
				<div>
					<h3>IP leak</h3>
					<hr>
				</div>
				<div>
					Peer-to-peer (P2P) is when a service goes from user to user for example sending a message to a friend (me -> friend), a non-P2P service routes traffic through a third-party, in the same message scenario (me -> third-party -> friend). By routing all communication though a third-party it masks all participants IP address. Some platforms like <a href="https://matrix.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Matrix secure, decentralized communication">Matrix</a> use the P2P protocol and others like <a href="https://discord.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Discord imagine a place">Discord</a> do not. 
				</div>
				<div style="padding-top: 1em;">
					Some of these chain messages claim that by adding the user to your friend list your IP address will be leaked, this claim does hold water on some platforms. Discord does not use P2P this means that by adding a user to your friend list you will not leak any IP address.  
					If these hackers had access to Discord's data, why would they need to add you as a friend? Discord stores their user's IP addresses according to their <a href="https://discord.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" name="Discord's privacy policy">privacy policy</a>.
					This does not mean that there is no way for a user to get your IP address for example going to a website exposes your IP to the site owner.

					<h3>Accounts DDoSed</h3>
					<hr>
				</div>

				<div>
					A distributed denial of service attack (DDos) is a type of attack where an attacker will use hundreds of internet connected devices to flood a target with fake resulting in the target being overloaded and going offline. 
					To execute a DDos attack you need the targets domain name (example.com) or IP address (93.184.216.34) <sup>[1]</sup> 
					It is possable to DDos a computer but it is imposable to DDos someone's account (discord or any other platform) due to an account on a platform is data stored in fancy spreadsheets. 
				</div> 
				<div style="padding-top: 1em;"> 
					<sup>[1]</sup> example.com is a site made to be used as a placeholder and 93.184.216.34 is the sites ip address. All websites host IP address is public information.

			<div id="copied">
				<div>
					<h3>Copied from other locations</h3>
					<hr>
				</div>

				<div>
					A few versions of this message say something like <q>This announcement is copied from other servers to spread the word. Idk if it is true but please be careful still</q>. 
					It looks to me like this statement had been added to validate the claims in the message. 
					It does not validate the claims in any way since other users could have altered the message. 
					The second part of this statement infuriates me the most because instead of taking the time to research the validity of the statement they send it, anyway, spreading fake information.

					<h3>From "Discord team"</h3>
					<hr>
				</div>

				<div>
					A few of these messages are signed by <q>Discord Team</q> no social media platform would encourage their users to spread information by re-sending the message to other users. This is for a few reasons: 
					<ul> 
						<li>It is slow</li> 
						<li>The platform could ban the user <sup>[1]</sup></li> 
						<li>Can cause panicking do to out of date information</li> 
						<li>Small coverage</li> 
						<li>The message can be altered</li> 
						<li>Dates such as tomorrow or 12:50 am can be misunderstood</li> 
						<li>Can cause inaccurate information due to interpretation</li> 
					</ul> 
				</div>
				<div>
					Instead, they would make a post on an official platform such as <a href="https://twitter.com/discord" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Discord's Twitter">Discord's Twitter</a> (For the Discord platform) other platforms would post on their own official profiles. 				
					Discord states in their article  <a href="https://discord.com/safety/360044104071-Tips-against-spam-and-hacking" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tips against spam and hacking</a><blockquote>Discord will only make announcements through our official channels. We do not distribute information secondhand through users or chainmail messages.</blockquote>
