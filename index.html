				<h4>intro</h4>
				<div>
					I have seen messages claming that a user will randomly send me a friend request on Discord and by accepting it my account will be hacked and they will get my IP address, and potenatly DDoSing me.
					however these messages are fake here is why.


					<!-- messages that go something like:<br><br> -->
					<!-- <code>
						@everyone Hello everyone, there is a possible chance today there will be a cyber-attack event where on all social networks including Discord there will be people trying to send you gore, racist insults, unholy pictures and there will also be IP thieves, Hackers and Doxxers.  I advise you not to accept any friend requests from people you do not know, stay safe.  Please broadcast on all servers where you have admin permissions or are owners and can ping to broadcast the warning. Make sure you are offline today, as that will be less likely to happen to you.  If possible, send this to your friends as well to spread the message more quickly, I repeat, stay safe.  It does not matter if it is real or not, the important thing is that everyone be careful with this delicate subject.
						Please be careful today.
	
						(Side note: This announcement is copied from other servers to spread the word. If you don't believe it, it's fine. Please be careful. To ensure you're safe in servers go to server privacy settings and turn off "people from this server can dm me" this will ensure no one will be enable to send you anything 18+ etc.)

						
						We are a small server so it probably won’t happen but stay safe everyone.

					<h3>IP leak</h3>
					<hr>
				</div>

				<div>
					Most of these will claim that by adding the user your ip address will be leaked this claim does hold some watter on some platforms. Discord is not Peer-to-peer (P2P) where as matrix for exaple is P2P.

					P2P is where 

					if i want to send my friend a message the flow is 
					me -> friend

					non P2P servacas go me -> servace(Discord or other) -> friend

					p2p normaly exposes ip address of both partys where as non p2p does not becuase the centeral server can mask all partisapants ips 
					
					this means that just by adding some one your ip is not exposed

					but there are other ways that pepole can get your ip

					for example going to a website exposes your ip to the site owner (your IP address is: PLACEHOLDER-IP)

					there are sites such as grabify

					<h3>Accounts DDoSed</h3>
					<hr>
				</div>

				<div>
					A distributed denial-of-service attack (DDos) is a type of attack
					where an attacker will use a hundrads of internet conected devices 
					to flood a target with fake trafic 
					witch can have the resutl of the target going offline.

					To exucate a DDos attack you need the targts hostname (example.com) or ip address (93.184.216.34)*

					It is impossable to DDos someones account (discord or any other platform) due to an account on a website is data stored in a fancy text file.
					<br>
					<i>* example.com is a site made to be used as a placeholder and 93.184.216.34 is its ip address so dont worry im not doxxing anyone here</i>

					<h3>Copied from other locations</h3>
					<hr>
				</div>

				<div>
					most of the versions that i have found of this message say something like <q>This announcement is copied from other servers to spread the word.</q>
					witch is a fair point to include but it does not validate the claims in any way
					due to the fact that other servers could have altered the message.

					the messages that inclue this sentance normaly includes <q>Idk if it's true but please be careful still</q> aswell 
					this is concerning becuase instead of taking the time to do a web search for <q>discord friend request hackers</q>
					and finding out if it is true before sending it they send it anyways

					would they do this with info about an election or something else important?
				</div>

			<!-- takes place tomorrow -->
			<div id="tomorrow">
				<div>
					<h3>"Tomorrow"</h3>
					<hr>
				</div>

				<div>
					in the messages about a possable cyber-attack event 
					they say the event will take place tomorrow.
					but when is tomorrow? or 12:50 am when it ends?
					time zones exist 
					and due to the fact that these messages are copy-pasted all over the place "tomorrow" is an ever changing date.

			<!-- from "the Discord Team" -->
			<div id="discordTeam">
				<div>
					<h3>From "Discord team"</h3>
					<hr>
				</div>

				<div>
					A few of these messages signed <q>Discord Team</q> no social media platform would encouge their users to spred information by sending the message to other users
					this is for a few reasons:
					<li>Its slow</li>
					<li>Causes panicing</li>
					<li>Small user coverage</li>
					<li>Message can be altered</li>
					Instead they would make a post on an offical platform such as <a href="https://twitter.com/discord" title="Discord's Twitter">Discord's Twitter</a> (for the Discord platform) other platforms would post on their own offical profiles.
