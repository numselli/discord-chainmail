					I have seen plenty of messages claming that a user with a spiffic username will randomly send me a friend request on Discord. By accepting the friend request my account will be hacked and the hacker will see my IP address, and potenatly DDoS me with it. These messages are fake, here is why.

					<h3>IP leak</h3>
					<hr>
				</div>

				<div>
					Peer-to-peer (P2P) is when a services goes from user to user for example sending a message to a friend (me -> friend), a non P2P service routes traffic thorugh a third-party, in the same message scenario (me -> third-party -> friend). By routing all communication though a third-party it masks all participants IP address. Some platforms like <a href="https://matrix.org/" title="Matrix secure, decentralized communication">Matrix</a> use the P2P protocol and others like <a href="https://discord.com/" title="Discord imagine a place">Discord</a> do not.
				</div>
				<div style="padding-top: 1em;">
					Some of these copypastas claim by adding the user to your friend list your IP address will be leaked, this claim does hold watter on some platforms. Discord does not use P2P this means that by adding a user to your friend list you will not leak any IP address. 
					This does not mean that there is no way for an user to get your IP address for example going to a website exposes your IP to the site owner (your IP address is: <span id="ip"></span>).

					<h3>Accounts DDoSed</h3>
					<hr>
				</div>

				<div>
					A distributed denial of service attack (DDos) is a type of attack where an attacker will use hundrads of internet conected devices to flood a target with fake resulting in the target being overloaded and going offline.

					To exucate a DDos attack you need the targts domain name (example.com) or ip address (93.184.216.34) <sup>[1]</sup>

					It is impossable to DDos someones account (discord or any other platform) due to an account on a platform is data stored in fancy spreadsheets.
				</div>
				<div style="padding-top: 1em;">
					<sup>[1]</sup> example.com is a site made to be used as a placeholder and 93.184.216.34 is the sites ip address. All websites host IP address is public information.

				<div>
					A few versions of this message say something like <q>This announcement is copied from other servers to spread the word. Idk if it's true but please be careful still</q>.
					It looks to me like this statment had been added to validate the claimes in the message.
					
					To me it does not validate the claims in any way due to the fact that other users could have altered the message.

					The second part of this statment infuriates me the most becuase instead of taking the time to google <q>Look out for a Discord user by the name of</q> and finding out that it is fake before sending it they send it anyways possably putting others in danger with fake information. Would they do this with info about an election or something else with a higher importantance?

					<h3>From "Discord team"</h3>
					<hr>
				</div>

				<div>
					A few of these messages are signed by <q>Discord Team</q> no social media platform would encouge their users to spred information by re-sending the message to other users
					this is for a few reasons:
					<ul>
						<li>Its slow</li>
						<li>Can causes panicing do to out of date information</li>
						<li>Relatively small coverage</li>
						<li>The message can be altered</li>
						<li>Dates such as tomorrow or 12:50 am can be misunderstood</li>
						<li>Can cause inaccruate information do to interpretation</li>
					</ul>
					Instead they would make a post on an offical platform such as <a href="https://twitter.com/discord" title="Discord's Twitter">Discord's Twitter</a> (for the Discord platform) other platforms would post on their own offical profiles.
