				<h4>intro</h4>
				<div>
					I have seen messages claming that a user will randomly send me a friend request on Discord and by accepting it my account will be hacked and they will get my IP address, and potenatly DDoSing me.
					however these messages are fake here is why.


					<!-- messages that go something like:<br><br> -->
					<!-- <code>
						@everyone Hello everyone, there is a possible chance today there will be a cyber-attack event where on all social networks including Discord there will be people trying to send you gore, racist insults, unholy pictures and there will also be IP thieves, Hackers and Doxxers.  I advise you not to accept any friend requests from people you do not know, stay safe.  Please broadcast on all servers where you have admin permissions or are owners and can ping to broadcast the warning. Make sure you are offline today, as that will be less likely to happen to you.  If possible, send this to your friends as well to spread the message more quickly, I repeat, stay safe.  It does not matter if it is real or not, the important thing is that everyone be careful with this delicate subject.
						Please be careful today.
	
						(Side note: This announcement is copied from other servers to spread the word. If you don't believe it, it's fine. Please be careful. To ensure you're safe in servers go to server privacy settings and turn off "people from this server can dm me" this will ensure no one will be enable to send you anything 18+ etc.)

						
						We are a small server so it probably won’t happen but stay safe everyone.

				<h3>From "Discord team"</h3>

				<div>
					A few of these messages signed <q>Discord Team</q> 
					no social media platform would encouge their users to spred information by sending the message to other users, instead they would make a post on an offical platform such as <a href="https://twitter.com/discord" title="Discord's Twitter">Discord's Twitter</a> (for the Discord platform) other platforms would post on their own offical profiles.
